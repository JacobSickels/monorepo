# Dogs Have Owners

A Ring is an arena where a course is set up and dogs do their runs. It's analagous to a baseball field. Some trials have one ring, with one course going during the day. Others have two rings operating simulataneously.

For example: in this ring, Standard goes first, starting at 8:00AM. The dogs in standard run "Tall to Small", so the Tallest dogs run first, then down the line. After all Standard class runs are complete, Jumpers With Weaves Class goes, Tall to Small, and so on. This running order needs to be adjustable, both by moving around whole Classes, and individual dog runs within a class |
| Each Height for each Level for each Class needs a Standard Course Time |  string   | What is the Standard Course time for this particular course? Example: 69 seconds. This is determined by the judge the day of the trial, determined by using a roller to measure the distance of the course, and this number is used for scoring. Kinda like a PAR score in golf.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

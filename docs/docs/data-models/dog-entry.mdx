This is the actual thing that says "this dog runs in this trial."

Usually older dogs do this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Move Up?                                        |      Boolean      | A move up is when a dog reaches a new level at a different trial, prior to this trial happening. Now, the dog that signed up for one level, needs to be moved up to a new one. If the trial is still open for entries, the user can switch the level on their own. But if not, they need to send a note to the Secretary so that she can make the changes. When this happens, we need to keep track of it with a boolean. |

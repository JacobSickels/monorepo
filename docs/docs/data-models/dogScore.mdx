# Dogs Have Owners

This is the data model for a dog's score. During a trial, there's going to be a list of dogs in their Running order. One by one, they will run and a user will use doggo UI to input the dog's score. This is that score

It's a 5 digit number, with the first two digits representing the dog's jump height, and the last three digits repping the dog for the whole day. SO, 12069 would be a 12 inch dog, running 69th of the day. This can be calculated once trial secretary locks in the order for the trial in the days before trail day |
